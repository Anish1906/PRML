#Anish Phule, PRML Project 2, Spring 2022

The following is the readme file for the Reinforcement Learning part 2 project code.

##maze_runner.py
This code is the code that 
-sets up deep learning before introducing the model
-updates state history for new values and previous location
-uses state and actions to move.

##deep_maze_runner.py
This is the main code that performs Deep Q-Learning based movement
-introduces neural network model and performs training
-does not use Q table
-takes one hot coding and target vector as input

##deep_maze_runner.ipynb
This is an ipynb file that contains all my results. You can import this into any notebook ide and view the code and results
